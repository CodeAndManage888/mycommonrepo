# Title: Spell Checker                                        *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  A spell checker can be a helpful tool for people who       *
# struggle to spell words correctly. In this exercise, you    *
# will write a program that reads a ﬁle and displays all of   *
# the words in it that are misspelled. Misspelled words will  *
# be identiﬁed by checking each word in the ﬁle against a     *
# list of known words. Any words in the user’s ﬁle that do    *
# not appear in the list of known words will be reported as   *
# spelling mistakes. The user will provide the name of the    *
# ﬁle to check for spelling mistakes as a command line        *
# parameter. Your program should display an appropriate error *
# message if the command line parameter is missing. An error  *
# message should also be displayed if your program is unable  *
# to open the user’s ﬁle. Use your solution to Exercise 111   *
# when creating your solution to this exercise so that words  *
# followed by a comma, period or other punctuation mark are   *
# not reported as spelling mistakes. Ignore the               *
# capitalization of the words when checking their spelling.   *
# Hint: While you could load all of the English words from    *
# the words data set into a list, searching a list is slow if *
# you use Python’s inoperator. It is much faster to check if  *
# a key is present in a dictionary, or if a value is present  *
# in a set. If you use a dictionary, the words will be the    *
# keys. The values can be the integer 0 (or any other value)  *
# because the values will never be used.                      *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

# Title: Count the Elements                                   *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Python’s standard library includes a method named count     *
# that determines how many times a speciﬁc value occurs in a  *
# list. In this exercise, you will create a new function      *
# named countRange which determines and returns the number of *
# elements within a list that are greater than or equal to    *
# some minimum value and less than some maximum value. Your   *
# function will take three parameters: the list, the minimum  *
# value and the maximum value. It will return an integer      *
# result greater than or equal to 0. Include a main program   *
# that demonstrates your function for several different       *
# lists, minimum values and maximum values. Ensure that your  *
# program works correctly for both lists of integers and      *
# lists of ﬂoating point numbers.                             *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

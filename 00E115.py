# Pig Latin is a language constructed by transforming English *
# words. While the ori- gins of the language are unknown, it  *
# is mentioned in at least two documents from the nineteenth  *
# century, suggesting that it has existed for more than 100   *
# years. The following rules are used to translate English    *
# into Pig Latin: If the word begins with a consonant        *
# (including y), then all letters at the beginning of the     *
# word, up to the ﬁrst vowel (excluding y), are removed and   *
# then added to the end of the word, followed by ay. For      *
# example, computer becomesomputercay andthink becomesinkthay *
# . If the word begins with a vowel (not including y),       *
# thenway is added to the end of the word. For example,       *
# algorithm becomesalgorithmway andoffice becomesofficeway .  *
# Write a program that reads a line of text from the user.    *
# Then your program should translate the line into Pig Latin  *
# and display the result. You may assume that the string      *
# entered by the user only contains lowercase letters and     *
# spaces.                                                     *
#                                                             *

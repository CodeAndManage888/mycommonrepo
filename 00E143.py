# Title: Concatenate Multiple Files                           *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Unix-based operating systems typically include a tool named *
# cat, which is short for concatenate. Its purpose is to      *
# concatenate and display one or more ﬁles whose names are    *
# provided as command line parameters. The ﬁles are displayed *
# in the same order that they appear on the command line.     *
# Create a Python program that performs this task. It should  *
# generate an appropriate error message for any ﬁle that      *
# cannot be displayed, and then proceed to the next ﬁle.      *
# Display an appropriate error message if your program is     *
# started without any command line parameters.                *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

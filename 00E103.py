# A magic date is a date where the day multiplied by the      *
# month is equal to the two digit year. For example, June 10, *
# 1960 is a magic date because June is the sixth month, and 6 *
# times 10 is 60, which is equal to the two digit year. Write *
# a function that determines whether or not a date is a magic *
# date. Use your function to create a main program that ﬁnds  *
# and displays all of the magic dates in the 20th century.    *

# Title: Shufﬂing a Deck of Cards                             *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# A standard deck of playing cards contains 52 cards. Each    *
# card has one of four suits along with a value. The suits    *
# are normally spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs while the   *
# values are 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. Each    *
# playing card can be represented using two characters. The   *
# ﬁrst character is the value of the card, with the values 2  *
# through 9 being represented directly. The characters “T”,   *
# “J”, “Q”, “K” and “A” are used to represent the values 10,  *
# Jack, Queen, King and Ace respectively. The second          *
# character is used to represent the suit of the card. It is  *
# normally a lowercase letter: “s” for spades, “h” for        *
# hearts, “d” for diamonds and “c” for clubs. The following   *
# table provides several examples of cards and their          *
# two-character representations. Card Abbreviation Jack of    *
# spades Js Two of clubs 2c Ten of diamonds Td Ace of hearts  *
# Ah Nine of spades 9s Begin by writing a function named      *
# createDeck . It will use loops to create a complete deck of *
# cards by storing the two-character abbreviations for all 52 *
# cards into a list. Return the list of cards as the          *
# function’s only result. Your function will not take any     *
# parameters. This copy belongs to 'acha04'Exercise 118:      *
# Shufﬂing a Deck of Cards 55 Write a second function named   *
# shuffle that randomizes the order of the cards in a list.   *
# One technique that can be used to shufﬂe the cards is to    *
# visit each element in the list and swap it with another     *
# random element in the list. You must write your own loop    *
# for shufﬂing the cards. You cannot make use of Python’s     *
# built-in shufﬂe function. Use both of the functions         *
# described in the previous paragraphs to create a main       *
# program that displays a deck of cards before and after it   *
# has been shufﬂed. Ensure that your main program only runs   *
# when your functions have not been imported into another     *
# ﬁle.                                                        *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

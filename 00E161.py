# Title: Missing Comments                                       *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  When one writes a function, it is generally a good idea to*
# include a comment that outlines the function’s purpose, its*
# parameters and its return value. However, some- times      *
# comments are forgotten, or left out by well-intentioned    *
# programmers that plan to write them later but then never   *
# get around to it. Create a python program that reads one or*
# more Python source ﬁles and identiﬁes functions that are   *
# not immediately preceded by a comment. For the purposes of *
# this exercise, assume that any line that begins with def,  *
# followed by a space, is the This copy belongs to           *
# 'acha04'Exercise 161: Missing Comments 77 beginning of a   *
# function deﬁnition. Assume that the comment character, #,  *
# will be the ﬁrst character on the previous line when the   *
# function has a comment. Display the names of all of the    *
# functions that are missing comments, along with the ﬁle    *
# name and line number where the function deﬁnition is       *
# located. The user will provide the names of one or more    *
# Python ﬁles as command line parameters. If your program    *
# encounters a ﬁle that doesn’t exist or can’t be opened then*
# it should display an appropriate error message before      *
# moving on and processing the remaining ﬁles.               *
#                                                             *

# Title: Dealing Hands of Cards                               *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# In many card games each player is dealt a speciﬁc number of *
# cards after the deck has been shufﬂed. Write a function,    *
# deal , which takes the number of hands, the number of cards *
# per hand, and a deck of cards as its three parameters. Your *
# function should return a list containing all of the hands   *
# that were dealt. Each hand will be represented as a list of *
# cards. When dealing the hands, your function should modify  *
# the deck of cards passed to it as a parameter, removing     *
# each card from the deck as it is added to a player’s hand.  *
# When cards are dealt, it is customary to give each player a *
# card before any player receives an additional card. Your    *
# function should follow this custom when constructing the    *
# hands for the players. Use your solution to Exercise 118 to *
# help you construct a main program that creates and shufﬂes  *
# a deck of cards, and then deals out four hands of ﬁve cards *
# each. Display all of the hands of cards, along with the     *
# cards remaining in the deck after the hands have been       *
# dealt.                                                      *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

    <h1>Lotto Results Monitor and Data Analysis: A Tech Solution for Every Pinoy's Raffle Dreams</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Greetings, fellow tech enthusiasts and Diskarteng Pinoy followers! Today, we embark on an exciting journey to create a tech solution that aims to bring hope and convenience to all Filipinos who dream of winning the lotto. Our project, the Lotto Results Monitor and Data Analysis, seeks to provide a simple yet powerful tool to keep track of lotto numbers and analyze historical data, offering a chance to explore interesting insights about this beloved raffle phenomenon.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

    <p>Lotto, a popular raffle in the Philippines, provides a glimmer of hope for many Pinoy who aspire to improve their lives overnight. While the chances of winning are slim, we often wonder if we've ever won without realizing it. This project aims to address this curiosity by developing a program that monitors the winning numbers, compares them with user-inputted choices, and sends notifications for potential winning combinations.</p>

    <h2>Overview of the Solution</h2>

    <p>Our journey began with the creation of an efficient extract mechanism, which checks a reliable and regularly updated website for lotto results. The extracted data is then stored in a simple text file that receives regular updates.</p>

    <p>Next, we envisioned a user-friendly interface where participants can enter their chosen numbers and the target date for the draw. The program will continuously monitor the results for a defined period and notify users via text message (courtesy of Twilio) if they have a winning combination, starting from three matched numbers and upwards.</p>

    <h2>Going Beyond: Additional Features</h2>

    <p>As our project evolved, we couldn't resist enhancing it with additional features that add value and deepen the lotto experience:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Creating a Winning Numbers and Prizes Dashboard:</strong> In addition to notifications, we decided to build a user-friendly dashboard that displays historical winning numbers and corresponding prizes. This feature allows users to analyze past patterns and potentially make informed choices for future draws.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyzing Economic Factors and Lotto Participation:</strong> The dataset collected over time opens the door to fascinating insights. We can explore whether economic conditions influence lotto participation and study how it correlates with the country's economic status.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifying Repeated Winning Numbers:</strong> Another exciting avenue we will explore is analyzing whether any chosen numbers have previously won in past draws. This analysis could help users strategize their number choices more effectively.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Project Status</h2>

    <p>Our project is already off to a great start! The extract process is coded and implemented, scheduled to run every 7 am daily. However, we've encountered a new challenge: extracting 15 years' worth of historical data. We are currently exploring reliable websites with easily accessible data to facilitate web scraping.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The Lotto Results Monitor and Data Analysis project is an exciting endeavor that not only aims to enhance convenience for lotto enthusiasts but also offers valuable insights into the raffle phenomenon in the Philippines. By combining tech-savvy solutions with data-driven analysis, we are on the path to create a one-of-a-kind tool that captures the essence of Diskarteng Pinoy Tech's mission. Stay tuned for our next project update, where we will dive into the web scraping process and uncover captivating findings from our historical data analysis. Until then, keep dreaming big and tech on, Pinoy!</p>

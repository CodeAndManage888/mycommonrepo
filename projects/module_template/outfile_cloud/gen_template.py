# Title: Is it a Valid Triangle?                              *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# If you have 3 straws, possibly of differing lengths, it may *
# or may not be possible to lay them down so that they form a *
# triangle when their ends are touching. For example, if all  *
# of the straws have a length of 6 inches. then one can       *
# easily construct an equilateral triangle using them.        *
# However, if one straw is 6 inches. long, while the other    *
# two are each only 2 inches. long, then a triangle cannot be *
# formed. In general, if any one length is greater than or    *
# equal to the sum of the other two then the lengths cannot   *
# be used to form a triangle. Otherwise they can form a       *
# triangle. Write a function that determines whether or not   *
# three lengths can form a triangle. The function will take 3 *
# parameters and return a Boolean result. In addition, write  *
# a program that reads 3 lengths from the user and            *
# demonstrates the behaviour of this function.                *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

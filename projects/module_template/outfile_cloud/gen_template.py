# Title: Reduce a Fraction to Lowest Terms                    *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Write a function that takes two positive integers that      *
# represent the numerator and denominator of a fraction as    *
# its only two parameters. The body of the function should    *
# reduce the fraction to lowest terms and then return both    *
# the numerator and denominator of the reduced fraction as    *
# its result. For example, if the parameters passed to the    *
# function are 6 and 63 then the function should return 2 and *
# 21. Include a main program that allows the user to enter a  *
# numerator and denominator. Then your program should display *
# the reduced fraction. Hint: In Exercise 75 you wrote a      *
# program for computing the greatest common divisor of two    *
# positive integers. You may Ô¨Ånd that code useful when        *
# completing this exercise.                                   *
#                                                             *

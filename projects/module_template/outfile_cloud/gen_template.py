# Title: Remove Outliers                                      *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# When analysing data collected as part of a science          *
# experiment it may be desirable to remove the most extreme   *
# values before performing other calculations. Write a        *
# function that takes a list of values and an non-negative    *
# integer, n, as its parameters. The function should create a *
# new copy of the list with the nlargest elements and the     *
# nsmallest elements removed. Then it should return the new   *
# copy of the list as the functionâ€™s only result. The order   *
# of the elements in the returned list does not have to match *
# the order of the elements in the original list. Write a     *
# main program that demonstrates your function. Your function *
# should read a list of numbers from the user and remove the  *
# two largest and two smallest values from it. Display the    *
# list with the outliers removed, followed by the original    *
# list. Your program should generate an appropriate error     *
# message if the user enters less than 4 values.              *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

# Title: The Twelve Days of Christmas                         *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# The Twelve Days of Christmas is a repetitive song that      *
# describes an increasingly long list of gifts sent to one’s  *
# true love on each of 12 days. A single gift is sent on the  *
# ﬁrst day. A new gift is added to the collection on each     *
# additional day, and then the complete collection is sent.   *
# The ﬁrst three verses of the song are shown below. The      *
# complete lyrics are available on the internet. On the ﬁrst  *
# day of Christmas my true love sent to me: A partridge in a  *
# pear tree. On the second day of Christmas my true love sent *
# to me: Two turtle doves, And a partridge in a pear tree. On *
# the third day of Christmas my true love sent to me: Three   *
# French hens, Two turtle doves, And a partridge in a pear    *
# tree. Your task is to write a program that displays the     *
# complete lyrics for The Twelve Days of Christmas. Write a   *
# function that takes the verse number as its only parameter  *
# and displays the speciﬁed verse of the song. Then call that *
# function 12 times with integers that increase from 1 to 12. *
# Each item that is sent to the recipient in the song should  *
# only appear once in your program, with the possible         *
# exception of the partridge. It may appear twice if that     *
# helps you handle the difference between “A partridge in a   *
# pear tree” in the ﬁrst verse and “And a partridge in a pear *
# tree” in the subsequent verses. Import your solution to     *
# Exercise 85 to help you complete this exercise.             *
#                                                             *

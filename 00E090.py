# Title: Does a String Represent an Integer?                  *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# In this exercise you will write a function named isInteger  *
# that determines whether or not the characters in a string   *
# represent a valid integer. When determining if a string     *
# represents an integer you should ignore any leading or      *
# trailing white space. Once this white space is ignored, a   *
# string represents an integer if its length is at least 1    *
# and it only contains digits, or if its ﬁrst character is    *
# either +or-and the ﬁrst character is followed by one or     *
# more characters, all of which are digits. Write a main      *
# program that reads a string from the user and reports       *
# whether or not it represents an integer. Ensure that the    *
# main program will not run if the ﬁle containing your        *
# solution is imported into another program. This copy        *
# belongs to 'acha04'Exercise 90: Does a String Represent an  *
# Integer? 43 Hint: You may ﬁnd the lstrip ,rstrip            *
# and/orstrip methods for strings helpful when completing     *
# this exercise. Documentation for these methods is available *
# online.                                                     *

# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

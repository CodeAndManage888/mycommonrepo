# Title: Display the Tail of a File                           *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Unix-based operating systems also typically include a tool  *
# named tail . It displays the last 10 lines of a ﬁle whose   *
# name is provided as a command line parameter. Write a       *
# Python program that provides the same behavior. Display an  *
# appropriate error message if the ﬁle requested by the user  *
# does not exist or if the command line parameter is omitted. *
# There are several different approaches that can be taken to *
# solve this problem. One option is to load the entire        *
# contents of the ﬁle into a list and then display the last   *
# 10 elements. Another option is to read the contents of the  *
# ﬁle twice, once to count the lines, and a second time to    *
# display the last 10 lines. However, both of these solutions *
# are undesirable when working with large ﬁles. Another       *
# solution exists that only requires you to read the ﬁle      *
# once, and only requires you to store 10 lines from the ﬁle  *
# at one time. For an added challenge, develop such a         *
# solution.                                                   *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

# Title: Roulette Payouts                                     *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# A roulettel whell has 38 spaces on it. Of these spaces, 18  *
# are black, 18 are red, and two are green. The green spaces  *
# are numbered 0 and 00. The red spaces are numbered 1, 3, 5, *
# 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34 and    *
# 36. The remaining integers between 1 and 36 are used to     *
# number the black spaces.                                    *
# Many different bets can be placed in roulette. We will only *
# consider the following subset of them in this exercise:     *
#                                                             *
# a. Single number (1 to 36, k0, or 00)                       *
# b. Red versus Black                                         *
# c. Odd versus Even (Note that 0 and 00 do not pay out for   *
# even)                                                       *
# d. 1 to 18 versus 19 to 36                                  *
#                                                             *
# Write a program that simulates a spin of a roulette wheel   *
# by using Python's random number generator. Display the      *
# number that was selected and all of the bets that must be   *
# payed. For example, if 13 is selected then your program     *
# should display:                                             *
#                                                             *
# The spin resulted in 13 . . .                               *
# Pay 13                                                      *
# Pay Black                                                   *
# Pay Odd                                                     *
# Pay 1 to 18                                                 *
#                                                             *
# If the simulation results in 0 or 00 then your program      *
# should display Pay 0 or Pay 00 without any further output.  *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

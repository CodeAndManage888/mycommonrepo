# Title: Check a Password                                     *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# In this exercise you will write a function that determines  *
# whether or not a password is good. We will deÔ¨Åne a good     *
# password to be a one that is at least 8 characters long and *
# contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one        *
# lowercase letter, and at least one number. Your function    *
# should return true if the password passed to it as its only *
# parameter is good. Otherwise it should return false.        *
# Include a main program that reads a password from the user  *
# and reports whether or not it is good. Ensure that your     *
# main program only runs when your solution has not been      *
# imported into another file                                  *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

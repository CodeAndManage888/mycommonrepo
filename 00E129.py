# Title: Two Dice Simulation                                  *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# In this exercise you will simulate 1,000 rolls of two dice. *
# Begin by writing a func- tion that simulates rolling a pair *
# of six-sided dice. Your function will not take any          *
# parameters. It will return the total that was rolled on two *
# dice as its only result. Write a main program that uses     *
# your function to simulate rolling two six-sided dice 1,000  *
# times. As your program runs, it should count the number of  *
# times that each total occurs. Then it should display a      *
# table that summarizes this data. Express the frequency for  *
# each total as a percentage of the total number of rolls.    *
# Your program should also display the percentage expected by *
# probability theory for each total. Sample output is shown   *
# below.                                                      *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

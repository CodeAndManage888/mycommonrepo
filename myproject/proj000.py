# This program uses the requests library to retrieve the HTML content of a website page and the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML and extract the content from the page. It then prints the content to the console.

# Keep in mind that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify the code to fit the specific needs of your application. For example, you might want to extract specific elements or attributes from the page, or process the content in some way before extracting it.

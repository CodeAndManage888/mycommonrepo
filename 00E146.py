# Title: Letter Frequencies                                   *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# One technique that can be used to help break some simple    *
# forms of encryption is frequency analysis. This analysis    *
# examines the encrypted text to determine which characters   *
# are most common. Then it tries to map the most common       *
# letters in English, such as E and T, to the most commonly   *
# occurring characters in the encrypted text. Write a program *
# that initiates this process by determining and displaying   *
# the frequencies of all letters in a file. Ignore spaces,    *
# punctuation marks, and numbers as you perform this          *
# analysis. Your program should be case insensitive, treating *
# a and A as equivalent. The user will provide the filename   *
# as a command line parameter. Your program should display a  *
# meaningful error message if the user provides the wrong     *
# number of command line parameters, or if the program is     *
# unable to open the Ô¨Åle indicated by the user.               *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

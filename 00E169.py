# Title: String Edit Distance                                   *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  The edit distance between two strings is a measure of     *
# their similarity—the smaller the edit distance, the more   *
# similar the strings are with regard to the minimum number  *
# of insert, delete and substitute operations needed to      *
# transform one string into the other. Consider the strings  *
# kitten andsitting . The ﬁrst string can be transformed into*
# the second string with the following operations: Substitute*
# the kwith ans, substitute the ewith ani, and insert a gat  *
# the end of the string. This is the smallest number of      *
# operations that can be performed to transform kitten       *
# intositting . As a result, the edit distance is 3.         *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

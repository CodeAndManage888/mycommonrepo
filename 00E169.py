# Title: String Edit Distance                                 *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  The edit distance between two strings is a measure of      *
# their similarity—the smaller the edit distance, the more    *
# similar the strings are with regard to the minimum number   *
# of insert, delete and substitute operations needed to       *
# transform one string into the other. Consider the strings   *
# kitten and sitting . The first string can be transformed    *
# into the second string with the following operations:       *
# Substitute the k with an s, substitute the e with an i, and *
# insert a g at the end of the string. This is the smallest   *
# number of operations that can be performed to               *
# transform kitten into sitting. As a result, the edit        *
# distance is 3.                                              *
#                                                             *

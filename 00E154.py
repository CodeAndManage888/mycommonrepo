# Title: Names that Reached Number One                          *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  The baby names data set consists of over 200 ﬁles. Each   *
# ﬁle contains a list of 100 names, along with the number of *
# times each name was used. There are two ﬁles for each year:*
# one containing names used for girls and the other          *
# containing names used for boys. The data set includes data *
# for every year from 1900 to 2012. Write a program that     *
# reads every ﬁle in the data set and identiﬁes all of the   *
# names that were most popular in at least one year. Your    *
# program should output two lists: one containing the most   *
# popular names for boys and the other containing the most   *
# popular names for girls. Neither of your lists should      *
# include any repeated values.                               *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

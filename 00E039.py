# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# The following table lists the sound level in decibels for   *
# several common noises.                                      *
#                                                             *
# Noise                Decibel Level (dB)                     *
# Jackhammer           130                                    *
# Gas lawnmower        106                                    *
# Alarm clock          70                                     *
# Quiet room           40                                     *

# Write a program that reads a sound level in decibel from    *
# the user. If the user enters a decibel level that matches   *
# one of the noises in the table then your program should     *
# display a message containing only that noise. If the user   *
# enters a number of decibels between the noises listed then  *
# your program should display a message indicating which      *
# noises the level in between. Ensure that your program also  *
# generates reasonable output for a value smaller than the    *
# quietest noise in the table, and for a value larger than    *
# the loudest noise in the table.                             *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

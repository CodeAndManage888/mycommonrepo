# Write a program that reads a magnitude from the user and    *
# displays the appropriate description as part of a           *
# meaningful message. For example, if the user enters 5.5     *
# then your program should indicate that a magnitude 5.5      *
# earthquake is considered to be a moderate earthquake.       *
#                                                             *

# Write a program that reads a date from the user and         *
# computes its immediate succcessor. For example, if the user *
# enters values that represent 2013-11-18 then your program   *
# should displaye a message indicating the day immediately    *
# after 2013-11-18 is 2013-11-19. If the user enter value     *
# represent 2013-11-30 then the program should indicate that  *
# the next day is 2013-12-01. If the usr entervalues that     *
# represent 2013-12-31 then the program should indicate that  *
# the next day is 2014-01-01. The date will be entered in     *
# numberic form with three separate input statements: one for *
# the year, one for the month, and one for the day. Ensure    *
# that your program works correctly for leap years.           *
#                                                             *

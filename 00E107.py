# In this exercise, you will create a program that reads      *
# words from the user until the user enters a blank line.     *
# After the user enters a blank line your program should dis- *
# play each word entered by the user exactly once. The words  *
# should be displayed in the same order that they were        *
# entered. For example, if the user enters: first second      *
# first third second then your program should display: first  *
# second third                                                *
#                                                             *

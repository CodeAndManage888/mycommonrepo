# Title: Square Root                                          *

# Write a program that implements Newton's method to compute  *
# and display the square root of a number entered by the user.*
# The algorithm for Newton's method follows:                  *
#                                                             *
# Read x from the user                                        *
# Initialize guess to x/2                                     *
# While guess is not good enough do                           *
#    Update guess to be the average of guess and x/guess      *
#                                                             *
# When this algorithm completes, guess contains an            *
# approximation of the square root. The quality of the        *
# appoximation depends on how you define "good enough". In    *
# the author's solution, guess was considered good enough     *
# when the absolute value of the difference between guess *   *
# guess and x was less than or equal to 10^-12.               *
#                                                             *

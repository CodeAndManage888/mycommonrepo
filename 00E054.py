# Title: Wavelengths of Visible Light                         *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# The wavelength of visible light ranges from 380 to 750      *
# nanometers (nm). While the sqpectrum is continuous, it is   *
# often divided into 6 colors as shown below:                 *
#                                                             *
# Color               Wavelength (nm)                         *
# ----------          ----------------------                  *
# Violet              380 to less than 450                    *
# Blue                450 to less than 495                    *
# Green               495 to less than 570                    *
# Yellow              570 to less than 590                    *
# Orange              590 to less than 620                    *
# Red                 620 to 750                              *
#                                                             *
# Write a program that reads a wavelength from the user and   *
# reports its color. Display an appropriate error message if  *
# the wavelength entered by the user is outside of the        *
# visible spectrum.                                           *
#                                                             *

# Title: Compute a Grade Point Average                        *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Exercise 51 included a table that shows the conversion from *
# letter grades to gradepoints at a particular academic       *
# institution. In this exercise you will compute thegrade     *
# point average of an arbitrary number of letter grades       *
# entered by the user. Theuser will enter a blank line to     *
# indicate that all of the grades have been provided. For     *
# example, if the user enters A, followed by C+, followed by  *
# B, followed by a blankline then your program should report  *
# a grade point average of 3.1.                               *
# You may find your solution to Exercise 51 helpful when      *
# completing this exercise.Your program does not need to do   *
# any error checking. It can assume that each valueentered by *
# the user will always be a valid letter grade or a blank     *
# line.                                                       *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

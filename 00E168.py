# Title: Recursive Square Root                                *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  Exercise 71 explored how iteration can be used to compute  *
# the square root of a number. In that exercise a better      *
# approximation of the square root was generated with each    *
# additional iteration of a loop. In this exercise you will   *
# use the same approximation strategy, but you will use       *
# recursion instead of iteration. Create a square root        *
# function that takes two parameters. The first parameter, n, *
# will be the number for which the square root is being       *
# computed. The second parameter, guess , will be the current *
# guess for the square root. The guess parameter should have  *
# a default value of 1.0. Do not provide a default value for  *
# the first parameter. Your square root function will be      *
# recursive. The base case occurs when guess 2 is within      *
# 10âˆ’12 of n. In this case your function should return guess  *
# because it is close enough to the square root of n.         *
# Otherwise your function should return the result of calling *
# itself recursively with n as the first parameter and guess  *
# +n guess 2 as the second parameter. Write a main program    *
# that demonstrate your square root function by computing the *
# square root of several different values. When you call your *
# square root function from the main program you should only  *
# pass one parameter to it so that the default value for      *
# guess is used.                                              *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

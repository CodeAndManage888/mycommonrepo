#  The novel “Gadsby” is over 50,000 words in length. While  *
# 50,000 words isn’t nor- mally remarkable for a novel, it is*
# in this case because none of the words in the book use the *
# letter “e”. This is particularly noteworthy when one       *
# considers that “e” is the most common letter in English.   *
# Write a program that reads a list of words from a ﬁle and  *
# determines what pro- portion of the words use each letter  *
# of the alphabet. Display the result for all 26 letters.    *
# Include an additional message identifying the letter that  *
# is used in the small- est proportion of the words. Your    *
# program should ignore any punctuation marks and it should  *
# treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent. This  *

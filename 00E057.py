# Title: Is it a Leap Year                                    *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for    *
# the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than   *
# that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included   *
# in some years to correct for this difference. Such years    *
# are referred to as leap years. The rules for determiniing   *
# whether or not a year is a leap year follow:                *
#                                                             *
# a.) Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.       *
# b.) Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by   *
#     100 is not a leap year.                                 *
# c.) Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 *
#     is a leap year.                                         *
# d.) All other year are not leap years.                      *
#                                                             *
# Write a program that reads a year from the user and         *
# displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap   *
# year.                                                       *
#                                                             *

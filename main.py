# Title: Generate All Sublists of a List                      *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Using the deÔ¨Ånition of a sublist from Exercise 125, write a *
# function that returns a list containing every possible      *
# sublist of a list. For example, the sublists of [1, 2, 3]   *
# are [],[1],[2],[3],[1, 2] ,[2, 3] and [1, 2, 3] . Note that *
# your function will always return a list containing at       *
# least the empty list because the empty list is a sublist of *
# every list. Include a main program that demonstrate your    *
# function by displaying all of the sublists of several       *
# different lists.                                            *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

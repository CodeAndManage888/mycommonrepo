# Title: Spelling with Element Symbols                        *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  Each chemical element has a standard symbol that is one,   *
# two or three letters long. One game that some people like   *
# to play is to determine whether or not a word can be        *
# spelled using only element symbols. For example, silicon    *
# can be spelled using the symbols Si, Li, C, O and N.        *
# However, hydrogen can not be spelled with any combination   *
# of element symbols. Write a recursive function that         *
# determines whether or not a word can be spelled using only  *
# element symbols. Your function will take two parameters:    *
# the word that you are trying to spell and a list of the     *
# symbols that can be used. Your function will return two     *
# results: a Boolean value indicating whether or not a        *
# spelling was found, and the string of symbols used to       *
# achieve the spelling (or an empty string if no spelling     *
# exists). Your function should ignore capitalization when    *
# searching for a spelling. Create a program that uses your   *
# function to ﬁnd and display all of the element names that   *
# can be spelled using only element symbols. Display the      *
# names of the elements along with the sequences of           *
# symbols. For example, one line of your output will be:      *
# Silver can be spelled as SiLvEr Your program will use the   *
# elements data set, which can be downloaded from the         *
# author’s website. This data set includes the names and      *
# symbols of all 118 chemical elements.                       *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

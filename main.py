# Title: Recursive Palindrome                                 *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  The notion of a palindrome was introduced previously in    *
# Exercise 72. In this exercise you will write a recursive    *
# function that determines whether or not a string is a       *
# palindrome. The empty string is a palindrome, as is any     *
# string containing only one character. Any longer string is  *
# a palindrome if its first and last characters match, and if *
# the string formed by removing the first and last characters *
# is also a palindrome.                                       *
# Write a main program that reads a string and from the user. *
# Use your recursive function to determine whether or not the *
# string is a palindrome. Then display an appropriate message *
# for the user                                                *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

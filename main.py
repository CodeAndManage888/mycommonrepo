# Title: Does a List contain a Sublist?                       *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# A sublist is a list that makes up part of a larger list. A  *
# sublist may be a list containing a single element, multiple *
# elements, or even no elements at all. For example, [1],     *
# [2],[3] and[4] are all sublists of [1, 2, 3, 4] . The       *
# list[2, 3] is also a This copy belongs to 'acha04'Exercise  *
# 125: Does a List contain a Sublist? 59 sublist of[1, 2, 3,  *
# 4] ,b u t[2, 4] is not a sublist [1, 2, 3, 4] because the   *
# elements 2and4are not adjacent in the longer list. The      *
# empty list is a sublist of any list. As a result, []is a    *
# sublist of [1, 2, 3, 4] . A list is a sublist of itself,    *
# meaning that [1, 2, 3, 4] is also a sublist of [1, 2, 3, 4] *
# . In this exercise you will create a function, isSublist ,  *
# that determines whether or not one list is a sublist of     *
# another. Your function should take two lists, larger        *
# andsmaller , as its only parameters. It should return True  *
# if and only if smaller is a sublist of larger . Write a     *
# main program that demonstrates your function.               *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

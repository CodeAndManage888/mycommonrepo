# Title: Words that Occur Most                                *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Write a program that displays the word (or words) that      *
# occur most frequently in a file. Your program should begin  *
# by reading the name of the file from the user. Then it      *
# should find the word(s) by splitting each line in the file  *
# at each space. Finally, any leading or trailing punctuation  *
# marks should be removed from each word. In addition, your   *
# program should ignore capitalization. As a result, apple    *
# ,apple! , Apple and ApPlE should all be treated as the same *
# word. You will probably find your solution to Exercise 111  *
# helpful when completing this problem.                       *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

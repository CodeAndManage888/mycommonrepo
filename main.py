# Title: Play Bingo                                           *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# In this exercise you will write a program that simulates a  *
# game of Bingo for a single card. Begin by generating a list *
# of all of the valid Bingo calls (B1 through O75). Once the  *
# list has been created you can randomize the order of its    *
# elements by calling the shuffle function in the random      *
# module. Then your program should consume calls out of the   *
# list, crossing out numbers on the card, until the card      *
# contains a crossed out line (horizontal, vertical or        *
# diagonal). Simulate 1,000 games and report the minimum,     *
# maximum and average number of calls that must be made       *
# before the card wins. Import your solutions to Exercises    *
# 138 and 139 when completing this exercise allow us to work  *
# with data, without needing to enter it each time our program*
# runs. Files also allow us to store results from our program *
# in a more permanent manner. These features are often used   *
# when creating larger programs. When completing the exercises*
# in this chapter, you should expect to: Open a ﬁle for      *
# reading and/or writing Read data from a ﬁle Write data to *
# a new ﬁle Use values provided to the program as command    *
# line parameters Detect and recover from errors such as      *
# attempting to open a ﬁle that doesn’t exist Detect and     *
# recover from other errors that are not speciﬁcally related  *
# to ﬁles Some of the exercises in this chapter involve       *
# reading from existing ﬁles such as a list of words, names or*
# chemical elements. You can download these ﬁles from the     *
# author’s website:                                           *

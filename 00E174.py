# Title: Run-Length Encoding                                  *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  Write a recursive function that implements the run-length  *
# compression technique described in Exercise 173. Your       *
# function will take a list or a string as its only para-     *
# meter. It should return the run-length compressed list as   *
# its only result. Include a main program that reads a string *
# from the user, compresses it, and displays the run-length   *
# encoded result. Hint: You may want to include a loop inside *
# the body of your recursive function.                        *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

# In the game of Scrabble™, each letter has points associated *
# with it. The total score of a word is the sum of the scores *
# of its letters. More common letters are worth fewer points  *
# while less common letters are worth more points. The points *
# associated with each letter are shown below: One point A,   *
# E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T and U Two points Da n dG Three       *
# points B, C, M and P Four points F, H, V, W and Y Five      *
# points K Eight points Ja n dX Ten points Qa n dZ Write a    *
# program that computes and displays the Scrabble™ score for  *
# a word. Create a dictionary that maps from letters to point *
# values. Then use the dictionary to compute the score. A     *
# Scrabble™ board includes some squares that multiply the     *
# value of a letter or the value of an entire word. We will   *
# ignore these squares in this exercise.                      *
#                                                             *

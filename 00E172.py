# Title: Element Sequences                                    *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  Another game that some people play with the names of       *
# chemical elements involves constructing a sequence of       *
# elements where each element in the sequence begins with the *
# last letter of its predecessor. For example, if a sequence  *
# begins with Hydrogen, then the next element must be an      *
# element that begins with N, such as Nickel. The element     *
# following Nickel must begin with L, such as Lithium. The    *
# element sequence that is constructed can not contain any    *
# duplicates. Write a program that reads the name of an       *
# element from the user. Your program should use a recursive  *
# function to ﬁnd the longest sequence of elements that       *
# begins with the entered element. Then it should display the *
# sequence. Ensure that your program responds in a reasonable *
# way if the user does not enter a valid element name. Hint:  *
# It may take your program up to two minutes to ﬁnd the       *
# longest sequence for some elements. As a result, you might  *
# want to use elements like Molybdenum and Magnesium as       *
# your first test cases. Each has a longest sequence that is  *
# only 8 elements long which your program should ﬁnd in a     *
# fraction of a second.                                       *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

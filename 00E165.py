#  Euclid was a Greek mathematician who lived approximately  *
# 2,300 years ago. His algorithm for computing the greatest  *
# common divisor of two positive integers, aand b, is both   *
# efﬁcient and recursive. It is outlined below: Ifbis 0then  *
# Return a Else Setcequal to the remainder when ais divided  *
# by b Return the greatest common divisor of bandc Write a   *
# program that implements Euclid’s algorithm and uses it to  *
# determine the greatest common divisor of two integers      *
# entered by the user.                                       *
#                                                             *

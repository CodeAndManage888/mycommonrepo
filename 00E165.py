#  Euclid was a Greek mathematician who lived approximately   *
# 2,300 years ago. His algorithm for computing the greatest   *
# common divisor of two positive integers, aand b, is both    *
# efﬁcient and recursive. It is outlined below: If bis 0 then *
# Return a Else Setc equal to the remainder when a is divided *
# by b Return the greatest common divisor of band c Write a   *
# program that implements Euclid’s algorithm and uses it to   *
# determine the greatest common divisor of two integers       *
# entered by the user.                                        *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

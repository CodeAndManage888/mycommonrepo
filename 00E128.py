# Title: Reverse Lookup                                       *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Write a function named reverseLookup that ﬁnds all of the   *
# keys in a dictionary that map to a speciﬁc value. The       *
# function will take the dictionary and the value to search   *
# for as its only parameters. It will return a (possibly      *
# empty) list of keys from the dictionary that map to the     *
# provided value. Include a main program that demonstrates    *
# the reverseLookup function as part of your solution to this *
# exercise. Your program should create a dictionary and then  *
# show that the reverseLookup function works correctly when   *
# it returns multiple keys, a single key, and no keys. Ensure *
# that your main program only runs when the ﬁle containing    *
# your solution to this exercise has not been imported into   *
# another program.                                            *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

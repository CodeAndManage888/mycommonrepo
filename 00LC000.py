# Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, 
# find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
# The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that 
# they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2 are not
# zero-based.
# Note: You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
# Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9 Outpu: [1,2]

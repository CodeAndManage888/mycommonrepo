# Title: Redacting Text in a File                               *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  Sensitive information is often removed, or redacted, from *
# documents before they are released to the public. When the *
# documents are released it is common for the redacted text  *
# to be replaced with black bars. In this exercise you will  *
# write a program that redacts all occurrences of sensitive  *
# words in a text ﬁle by replacing them with asterisks. Your *
# program should redact sensitive words wherever they occur, *
# even if they occur in the middle of another word. The list *
# of sensitive words will be provided in a separate text ﬁle.*
# Save the redacted version of the original text in a new    *
# ﬁle. The names of the original text ﬁle, sensitive words   *
# ﬁle, and redacted ﬁle will all be provided by the user. You*
# may ﬁnd the replace method for strings helpful when        *
# completing this exercise. Information about the replace    *
# method can either be found in your textbook or on the      *
# internet. For an added challenge, extend your program so   *
# that it redacts words in a case insensitive manner. For    *
# example, if exam appears in the list of sensitive words    *
# then redactexam ,Exam ,ExaM andEXAM , among other possible *
# capitalizations.                                           *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

# Title: Remove Comments                                      *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Python uses the #character to mark the beginning of a       *
# comment. The comment ends at the end of the line containing *
# the #character. In this exercise, you will create a program *
# that removes all of the comments from a Python source ﬁle.  *
# Check each line in the ﬁle to determine if a #character is  *
# present. If it is then your program should remove all of    *
# the characters from the #character to the end of the line   *
# (we’ll ignore the situation where the comment character     *
# occurs inside of a string). Save the modiﬁed ﬁle using a    *
# new name that will be entered by the user. The user will    *
# also enter the name of the input ﬁle. Ensure that an        *
# appropriate error message is displayed if a problem is      *
# encountered while accessing the ﬁles.                       *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

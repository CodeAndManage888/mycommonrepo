# Title: Line of Best Fit                                     *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# A line of best ﬁt is a straight line that best approximates *
# a collection of ndata points. In this exercise, we will     *
# assume that each point in the collection has an xcoordinate *
# and a ycoordinate. The symbols ¯xand¯yare used to represent *
# the average xvalue in This copy belongs to 'acha04'54 5     *
# List Exercises the collection and the average yvalue in the *
# collection respectively. The line of best ﬁt is represented *
# by the equation y=mx+bwhere mandbare calculated using the   *
# following formulas:                                         *
# m=/summationtextxy−(/summationtextx)(/summationtexty) n     *
# /summationtextx2−(/summationtextx)2 n b=¯y−m¯x Write a      *
# program that reads a collection of points from the user.    *
# The user will enter the x part of the ﬁrst coordinate on    *
# its own line, followed by the y part of the ﬁrst coordinate *
# on its own line. Allow the user to continue entering        *
# coordinates, with the xandyparts each entered on their own  *
# line, until your program reads a blank line for             *
# thexcoordinate. Display the formula for the line of best ﬁt *
# in the form y=mx+b by replacing mandbwith the values you    *
# calculated using the preceding formulas. For example, if    *
# the user inputs the coordinates (1,1),(2,2.1)and(3,2.9)then *
# your program should display y=0.95x+0.1.                    *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

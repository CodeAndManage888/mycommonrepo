# Title: Line of Best Fit                                     *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# A line of best ﬁt is a straight line that best approximates *
# a collection of ndata points. In this exercise, we will     *
# assume that each point in the collection has an xcoordinate *
# and a ycoordinate. The symbols ¯x and ¯y are used to        *
# represent the average xvalue in This copy belongs to the    *
# collection and the average y value in the collection        *
# respectively. The line of best fit is represented by the    *
# equation y = mx + b where m and b are calculated using the  *
# following formulas:                                         *
#                       (summation x) * (summation y)         *
#        summation xy − ----------------------------          *
#                                  n                          *
#   m =  -------------------------------------------          *
#           (summation x**2) − (summation x)**2               *
#                              ----------------               *
#                                     n                       *
#           b = ¯y − m¯x                                      *
# Write a program that reads a collection of points from the  *
# user. The user will enter the x part of the ﬁrst coordinate *
# on its own line, followed by the y part of the ﬁrst         *
# coordinate on its own line. Allow the user to continue      *
# entering coordinates, with the x and y parts each entered   *
# on their own line, until your program reads a blank line for*
# the x coordinate. Display the formula for the line of best  *
# fit in the form y = mx + b by replacing m and b with the    *
# values you calculated using the preceding formulas. For     *
# example, if the user inputs the coordinates (1,1),(2,2.1)   *
# and (3,2.9) then your program should display y = 0.95x + 0.1*
#                                                             *

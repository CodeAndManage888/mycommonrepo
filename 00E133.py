# Title: Write Out Numbers in English                         *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# While the popularity of cheques as a payment method has     *
# diminished in recent years, some companies still issue them *
# to pay employees or vendors. The amount being paid normally *
# appears on a cheque twice, with one occurrence written      *
# using digits, and the other occurrence written using        *
# English words. Repeating the amount in two different forms  *
# makes it much more difﬁcult for an unscrupulous employee or *
# vendor to modify the amount on the cheque before depositing *
# it. In this exercise, your task is to create a function     *
# that takes an integer between 0 and 999 as its only         *
# parameter, and returns a string containing the English      *
# words for that number. For example, if the parameter to the *
# function is 142 then your function should return “one       *
# hundred forty two ”. Use one or more dictionaries to        *
# implement your solution rather than large if/elif/else      *
# constructs. Include a main program that reads an integer    *
# from the user and displays its value in English words.      *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

# Title: No More Pennies                                      *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# February 4, 2013 was the last day that pennies were         *
# distributed by the Royal Canadian Mint. Now that pennies    *
# have been phased out retailers must adjust totals so that   *
# they are multiples of 5 cents when they are paid for with   *
# cash (credit card and debit card transations continue to be *
# chared to the penny). While retailers have some freedome in *
# how they do this, most choose to round to the closes nickel.*
#                                                             *
# Write a program that reads prices from the user until a     *
# blank line is entered. Display the total cost of all the    *
# entered items on one line, followed by the amount due if    *
# the customer pays with cash on a second line followed by    *
# the amount due if the customer poays with cash on a second  *
# line. The amount due for a cas payment should be rounded to *
# the neares nickel. One way to compute the cash payment      *
# amount is to begin by determining how many pennies would be *
# needed to pay the toal. Then compute the remainder when     *
# this number of pennies is divided by 5. Finally, adjust the *
# total down if the reminder is less tha 2.5. Otherwise adjust*
# the total up.                                               *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

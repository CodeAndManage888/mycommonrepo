# Title: Season from Month and Day                            *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# The year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall *
# and winter. While the exact dates that the seasons change   *
# vary a little bit from year to year because of the way that *
# the calendar is constructed, we will use the following      *
# dates for this exercise:                                    *
# Season                First Day                             *
# Spring                March 20                              *
# Summer                June 21                               *
# Fall                  September 22                          *
# Winter                December 21                           *
# Create a program that reads a month and day from the user.  *
# The user will enter the name of the month as a string,      *
# followed by the day within the month as an integer. Then    *
# your program should display the season associated with the  *
# date that was entered.                                      *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Create a program that reads integers from the user until a  *
# blank line is entered. Once all of the integers have been   *
# read your program should display all of the negative        *
# numbers, followed by all of the zeros, followed by all of   *
# the positive numbers. Within each group the numbers should  *
# be displayed in the same order that they were entered       *
# by the user. For example, if the user enters the values 3,  *
# -4, 1, 0,-1, 0, and-2 then your program should output the   *
# values -4,-1,-2, 0, 0, 3, and 1. Your program should        *
# display each value on its own line.                         *
#                                                             *

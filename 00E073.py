# Title: Multiple Word Palindromes                            *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# There are numerous phrases that are palindromes when        *
# spacing is ignored. Examples include "go dog", "flee to me  *
# remote elf" and "some men interpret nine memos", among many *
# other, Extend your solution to Exercise 72 so that it       *
# ignores spacing while determining whether or not a string   *
# is a palindrome. For an additional challenge, extend your   *
# solution so that is also ignores punctuation marks and      *
# treats uppercase and lowrcase letters as equivalent.        *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

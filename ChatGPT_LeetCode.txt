Two Sum (Problem 1) - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Palindrome Number (Problem 9) - Check if an integer is a palindrome without converting it to a string.

Reverse Integer (Problem 7) - Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0.

Merge Two Sorted Lists (Problem 21) - Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list.

Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Problem 121) - You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and you want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Valid Parentheses (Problem 20) - Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

Single Number (Problem 136) - In a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Climbing Stairs (Problem 70) - You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Maximum Subarray (Problem 53) - Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Fibonacci Number (Problem 509) - The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1. Given n, calculate F(n).

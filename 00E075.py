# Title: Greatest Common Divisor                              *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, n and *
# m, is the largest number, d, which divides evenly into both *
# n and m. There are algorithms that can be used to solve     *
# this problem, including:                                    *
#                                                             *
# Initialize d to the smaller of m and n.                     *
# While d does not evenly divide m or d does not evenly       *
# divide n do                                                 *
#    Decrease the value of d by 1                             *
# Report d as the greates common divisor of n and m           *
#                                                             *
# Write a program that reads two positive integers from the   *
# user and uses this algorithm to determine and report their  *
# greatest common divisor.                                    *
#                                                             *

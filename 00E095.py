# Title: Random License Plate                                 *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# In a particular jurisdiction, older license plates consist  *
# of three letters followed by three numbers. When all of the *
# license plates following that pattern had been used, the    *
# format was changed to four numbers followed by three        *
# letters. Write a function that generates a random license   *
# plate. Your function should have approximately equal odds   *
# of generating a sequence of characters for an old license   *
# plate or a new license plate. Write a main program that     *
# calls your function and displays the randomly generated     *
# license plate.                                              *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

# Title: Reduce Measures                                      *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Many recipe books still use cups, tablespoons and teaspoons *
# to describe the volumes of ingredients used when cooking or *
# baking. While such recipes are easy enough to follow if you *
# have the appropriate measuring cups and spoons, they can be *
# difﬁcult to double, triple or quadruple when cooking        *
# Christmas dinner for the entire extended family. For        *
# example, a recipe that calls for 4 tablespoons of an        *
# ingredient requires 16 tablespoons when quadrupled.         *
# However, 16 tablespoons would be better expressed (and      *
# easier to measure) as 1 cup. Write a function that          *
# expresses an imperial volume using the largest units pos-   *
# sible. The function will take the number of units as its    *
# ﬁrst parameter, and the unit of measure (cup, tablespoon or *
# teaspoon) as its second parameter. Return a string          *
# representing the measure using the largest possible units   *
# as the function’s only result.                              *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

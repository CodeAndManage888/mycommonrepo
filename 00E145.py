# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# In this exercise you will create a Python program that      *
# identiﬁes the longest word(s) in a ﬁle. Your program should *
# output an appropriate message that includes the length of   *
# the longest word, along with all of the words of that       *
# length that occurred in the ﬁle. Treat any group of         *
# non-white space characters as a word, even if it includes   *
# numbers or punctuation marks.                               *
#                                                             *

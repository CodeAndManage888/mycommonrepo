# Title: Arbitrary Base Conversions                           *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Write a program that allows the user to convert a number    *
# from one base to another. Your program should support bases *
# between 2 and 16 for both the input number and the result   *
# number. If the user chooses a base outside of this range    *
# then an appropriate error message should be displayed and   *
# the program should exit. Divide your program into several   *
# functions, including a function that converts from an       *
# arbitrary base to base 10, a function that converts from    *
# base 10 to an arbitrary base, and a main program that reads *
# the bases and input number from the user. You may Ô¨Ånd your  *
# solutions to Exercises 77, 78 and 98 helpful when           *
# completing this exercise.                                   *
#                                                             *

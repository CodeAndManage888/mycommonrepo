# from 1 to 15, the numbers that can appear under the Irange  *
# from 16 to 30, the numbers that can appear under theNrange  *
# from 31 to 45, and so on. Write a function that creates a   *
# random Bingo card and stores it in a dictionary. The keys   *
# will be the letters B,I,N,GandO. The values will be the     *
# lists of ﬁve numbers that appear under each letter. Write a *

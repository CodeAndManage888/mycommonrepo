# Title: Caesar Cipher                                        *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# One of the first known examples of encryption was used by   *
# Julius Caesar. Caesar needed to provide written             *
# instructions to his generals, but he didnâ€™t want his        *
# enemies to learn his plans if the message slipped into      *
# their hands. As result, he developed what later became      *
# known as the Caesar Cipher.                                 *
# The idea behind this cipher is simple (and as a result, it  *
# provides no protection against modern code breaking         *
# techniques). Each letter in the original message is shifted *
# by 3 places. As a result, A becomes D, B becomes E, C       *
# becomes F, D becomes G, etc. The last three letters in the  *
# alphabet are wrapped around to the beginning: X becomes A,  *
# Y becomes B and Z becomes C. Non-letter characters are not  *
# modified by the cipher.                                     *
# Write a program that implements a Caesar cipher. Allow the  *
# user to supply the message and the shift amount, and then   *
# display the shifted message. Ensure that your program       *
# encodes both upper case and lowercase letters. Your program *
# should also support negative shift values so that it can be *
# used both to encode messages and decode messages.           *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

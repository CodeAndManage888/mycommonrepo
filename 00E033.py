# Title: Day Old Bread                                        *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# A bakery sells loaves of bread for $3.49 each. Day old      *
# bread is discounted by 60 percent. Write a program that     *
# begins by reading the number of loaves of day old bread     *
# being purchased from the user. Then your program should     *
# display the regular price for the bread, the discount       *
# because it is a day old, and the total price. All of the    *
# values should be displayed using two decimal places, and    *
# the decimal points in all of the numbers should be aligned  *
# when reasonable values are entered by the users.            *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

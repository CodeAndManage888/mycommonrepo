# Title: Repeated Words                                       *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
#  Spelling mistakes are only one of many different kinds of  *
# errors that might appear in a written work. Another error   *
# that is common for some writers is a repeated word. For     *
# example, an author might inadvertently duplicate a word, as *
# shown in the following sentence: At least one value must be *
# entered entered in order to compute the average. Some word  *
# processors will detect this error and identify it when a    *
# spelling or grammar check is performed. In this exercise    *
# you will write a program that detects repeated words in a   *
# text file. When a repeated word is found your program should*
# display a message that contains the line number and the     *
# repeated word. Ensure that your program correctly handles   *
# the case where the same word appears at the end of one line *
# and the beginning of the following line, as shown in the    *
# previous example. The name of the file to examine will be   *
# provided as the programâ€™s only command line parameter.      *
# Display an appropriate error message if the user fails to   *
# provide a command line parameter, or if an error occurs     *
# while processing the file.                                  *
#                                                             *
# Computed Result Validated:                                  *

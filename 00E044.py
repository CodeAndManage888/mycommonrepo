# Title: Date to Holiday Name                                 *
# Status: In Progress (In Progress / Testing / Working)       *
# Canada has three national holidays which fall on the same   *
# dates each year. Write a program that reads a month and day *
# from the user. If the month and day match one of the        *
# holidays listed previously then your proogram should        *
# display the holiday's name. Otherwise your program should   *
# indicate that the entered month and day do not correspond   *
# to the fixed-date holiday.                                  *
# Canada has two additional national holidays, Good Friday    *
# and Labour Day, whose dates vary from year to year. There   *
# are also numerous provincial and territorial holidays, some *
# of which have fixed dates, and some of which have variable  *
# dates. We will not consider any of these additional         *
# holidays in this exercise.                                  *
#                                                             *
# Coder Additional Features:                                  *
# 1.) The program will be able to accept 1 format of the date *
#     but can distinguesh if it is written in upper or lower  *
#     case.                                                   *
# 2.) The program will only accept 1 input e.g. Jan 1 but no  *
#     year will be accepted.                                  *
# 3.) That program will be able to detect if the data is      *
#     valid or not e.g. Feb 30                                *

# Computed Result Validated:                                  *
